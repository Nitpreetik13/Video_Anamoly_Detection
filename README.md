# Video Anomaly Detection using OpenCV

## Introduction
This Python script uses OpenCV to perform video anomaly detection. It loads a video file, processes its frames, and detects anomalies within the video. Detected anomalies are marked with bounding boxes, and the edited video with bounding boxes is saved as a new video file.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3
- OpenCV (cv2)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Make sure you have Python 3 and OpenCV installed.
   
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python

Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal:


    python your_script_name.py
### Replace your_script_name.py with the name of your Python script.

The script will process the video, detect anomalies, and save the edited video with bounding boxes.

## Configuration
  -Modify the video_file variable to specify the path of the video you want to analyze ("3.mp4" in the provided code).
  -You can customize the output video format, frame rate, and dimensions by changing the arguments of cv2.VideoWriter as per your requirements.
  -Ensure you have the video file in the same directory as your script or provide the full path to the video.
## Results
  -Detected anomalies will be printed in the console, along with the frames where they occur.
  -The edited video with bounding boxes will be saved in the same directory as the script (e.g., "3edited.mp4").
##Acknowledgments
-This script uses OpenCV for video processing and anomaly detection.
-Feel free to customize and enhance this script to meet your specific needs.



Replace `"your_script_name.py"` with the actual name of your Python script if it's different. You can also add more details, documentation, or instructions as needed.
